How to use:
Step 1:Open the .exe file
Step 2: Either load a file, such as the provided example
       UndoneExample.txt, or not load the file.
Step 3: Enjoy! Press the new item to add a new item, press the item name to edit,
        use open to open more files and combine them, and save to save your file.
Note: Some files contain the word 'Unit' before it, this is because Lazarus broke and
      refuseto compile the file or just skipped the files, so I was forced to recreate
      the project. I had to include Unit to not get an illegal name error.
	  
	  When only the project, Lazarus may say that the file is not found. This is because
	  I was forced to point it to a directory. You can try to continue loading, it should
	  be fine. If it doesn't work, try using something like Notepad++
	  
	  You might also be unable to compile the files due to the reason stated above. This
	  is a very last moment solution that I was forced to use and I hope you can understand.
